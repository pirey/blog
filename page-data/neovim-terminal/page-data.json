But when I open new tmux pane or window, the layout of my screen is changed and it is kinda break my state of focus when writing code. I find it more pleasant to open terminal inside neovim directly as it doesn’t change my current focus. I feel that I don’t loose control of the things I’m working on.</p>\n<p>The basic command to open built-in terminal is <code class=\"language-text\">:terminal</code>, but it just open it on current buffer, which drags my attention away from the code I’m working, which is a no.</p>\n<p>I want to open new terminal in a new split. I tried to mimic the behavior of vscode built-in terminal, that is to open new terminal at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Basically I need to open new split, at the bottom of the screen, and call the terminal command. I also choose to create new command to do the thing.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">command!
